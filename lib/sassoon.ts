    subtitle: "Nicolas Sassoon",
    content:
      "Nicolas Sassoon employs early computer imaging techniques to render architectures, landscapes, and natural forces. Sassoon’s practice translates ideas of materiality and immateriality into digital animations, installations, prints, and sculptures. His work explores the contemplative and projective dimensions of screen-based space, and how the digital image can express dimensions of the physical realm.",

    content:
      "Itzel Yard, known by her artistic pseudonym Ix Shells, is a Panamanian-based new media artist specializing in sound, generative art and the creative space between the two. The artistic capabilities of computational systems sparked her interest at an early age through her passion for music and video games. Supplemented by her studies in architectural technology, she creates works with exquisite detail and spatial depth, often pulling patterns present in her daily life, before abstracting them together through elements of digital aesthetics like glitch, gradients and pixelation.",

    content:
      "Tali Hinkis and Kyle Lapidus began collaborating as LoVid in 2000. An alchemy of independent interests in technology has defined LoVid's aesthetic, combining craft-oriented analog processes and playful engineering with natural and social science. LoVid's interdisciplinary works explore the often invisible or intangible aspects of contemporary society, such as communication systems and biological signals. LoVid is particularly interested in the ways technology seeps into the evolution of human culture.",

    content:
      "Drawing on a background in typography and the design of physical spaces, Emily’s generative work invents new grid systems and uses simple shapes to uncover what is possible within strict formal constraints. Conversations ensue across scales and between colors, creating optical effects and emergent forms.\n\nEmily’s work explores communication, scale shift, color theory, and the “visible pixel” - a celebration of the physical module upon which digital art is created.",
